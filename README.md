The Customer Churn Prediction project leverages machine learning to identify customers likely to discontinue a service, enabling proactive retention strategies.
The workflow begins with 
1. data preprocessing 
2. including handling missing values 
3. encoding categorical variables.
   
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helps uncover trends and relationships.
Feature selection techniques like
1. correlation analysis
2. univariate tests
3. model-based importance are applied to choose the most impactful predictors.
Multiple models such as
1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest
3. XGBoost are trained 
4. evaluated using metrics like accuracy and F1-score.
This end-to-end project demonstrates how data-driven approaches can help businesses minimize churn and improve customer loyalty.
